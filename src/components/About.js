                <p>I am a Btech student studying in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE). Apart from this, I am more interested in the emerging artificial intelligence tools, and that made me more interested in looking at them and how the predictions are being made. This made me want to work on some cool projects, and while dealing with this, I fell in love with the web development part and loved working in the backend as compared to the frontend, which made me interested in participating in various hackathons and attending various tech fests. And Below is my education background.</p>
